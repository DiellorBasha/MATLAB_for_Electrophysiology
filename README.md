## Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB code used to generate figures for the following publications:

> *Title: The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus facilitates hippocampo-cortical dialogue during sleep*  
> Authors: Diellor Basha, Amirmohammad Azarmehri, Eliane Proulx, Sylvain Chauvette, Maryam Ghorbani, Igor Timofeev  
> Published in: eLife  
> DOI: [https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90826](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90826)

The core function, `wavelet_event_analysis.m`, computes the wavelet transform of EEG data surrounding event onsets, averages the results across multiple trials, and visualizes the frequency-time representation.
